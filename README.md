This repository contains the specifications, schemas, and other reference material for OFSCP.

[See the spec](docs/ofscp_spec.md)

## Goals

The primary goal of OFSCP is to provide an open and federated standard for online social communicatoins and managing online communities. It includes functionality like group messaging and video calls, and covers use-cases from forums, to blogs, to private messaging. All with modern real-time communication features and convenience that users expect.

OFSCP is focused on:

* **Simplicity & Reliability**:
	
	Easy to implement and reliable. Minimizes state mismatches by adhering to a single source of truth where reasonable.

* **Compatibility**:

	Everything implementing OFSCP will provide a consistent, seamless user experience, across any combination of clients and servers.

* **Flexibility**:

	Covers a wide variety of use-cases and leaves room for innovative implementations.

## Reasoning

I believe that OFSCP can fill a specific but potent need in the landscape of the modern internet.

### The Problem

Nowadays, I think most everyone hates social media. In my anecdotal experience, there's an increasing nostalgia for the "good old" internet, when content on the web could be hosted by anyone and wasn't seemingly all owned by corporations. Content was something you sought out, and if you made a site or a blog, it was *yours*, not some corporation's.

But if the old internet was so much better, why doesn't everyone quit social media and go back? There's nothing technically in the way. The answer is simple: **Convenience**.

I *could* go to your site to check your latest blog post. Or, I could follow you on Twitter and let your latest updates come to me. I *could* go to a forum page looking for help, or I could join the Discord server with the account I already have, and get an immediate response.

The power of convenience feels too strong for everyone to go back. We're all locked into these specific platforms where "everyone else is".

But I think there's no reason we can't have the freedom of the old web with the convenience we've gotten used to.

### The Attempt at a Solution

What if you could "follow" your favorite blogs, and see all of the new posts in the same feed? What if you could join a random website's forum, and then access it from an app on your phone? What if you could host your own Discord- or Slack-like experience?

And, most importantly, what if all of these things were tied together, so you only need one account, and it was all accessible from a client of your choosing?

This is what OFSCP aims to provide. A way to put content and communities back in the hands of creators and people, not platforms. All *without* sacrificing the modern convenience that these platforms provide.
